    "After going through this section, you will learn to customize an simulation environment with developer APIs. Before this, let's discuss what a simulation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "> *Simulation is the process of creating a model of a real or imagined system and then conducting experiments with this model. The purpose is usually to understand how the system works, to predict its behavior under different conditions, or to develop strategies for its operation. This is akin to creating a miniature, controllable version of a complex system in a virtual or conceptual space, where you can observe, experiment, and understand the outcomes without having to interact with the real system. This approach is invaluable in scenarios where real-world experimentation is impractical, dangerous, or impossible.*\n",

    "The mathematical definition of simulation is a **transition probability function**, $P(s' | s)$, which gives the probability of transitioning to state $s'$ given current state $s$.\n",
    "For a deterministic simulation, the **transition probability function** can be simplified as a **transition function** $s' = \\mathcal T (s) $. It means the state $s$ will always be transferred to the state $s'$. MetaDrive is a deterministic simulator and thus outcomes across repetitive runs will be the same if initial conditions and the random seed are identical. Therefore, MetaDrive is defined with the **state space** $S$ and **the transition function** $\\mathcal T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an autonomous driving simulator, for each state $s \\in S$, it consists of all static objects' information like the map structure and all dynamic objects' properties, i.e. positions, headings, velocities, and so on. \n",
    "As the static objects won't change throughout the whole simulated episode, i.e. map structure, the new state $s'$ produced by **transition function** mainly differentiates $s$ in the following aspects: \n",
    "- properties of existing dynamic objects are updated\n",
    "- properties of new dynamic objects are included if any new dynamic objects are spawned\n",
    "- properties of existing dynamic objects are deleted if any dynamic objects should be recycled\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the state space is defined and constrained to the 3D physics world, the work remaining for developers to build a driving simulation is to compose the **transition function** completing the aforementioned three tasks. Concretely, if the *openai-gym* style APIs are used, the three tasks should happen in the `env.step()` and be repeated again and again to simulate a driving scene. The following two consecutive frames illustrate the role of **transition function** in MetaDrive. The cars in black, red, and purple boxes show recycling, spawning, and actuation respectively.\n",

    "As we use the bullet engine for underlying physics simulation, the `self.engine.step()` is actually a wrapper for repeatedly executing `BulletWorld.doPhysics(dt, 1, dt)`, where `dt` is the minimal sub-timestep for integration. A smaller `dt` produces a more accurate simulation. The `doPhysics()` is repeated by `decision_repeat` times and finally, the simulation will forward `dt * decision_repeat` seconds after calling `engine.step()`. This period is set to `0.1s` by default with `dt=0.02` and `decision_repeat=5`. For example, the vehicle's speed will be increased to $5\\ m/s$ at state $s'$ if it has a $4.9\\ m/s$ speed with a $1m\\ /s^2$ acceleration before advancing the simulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Before advancing the physics world, there may be some preparations required. For example, if the external input contains signals for controlling a certain vehicle, the steering angles and the throttle value should be set on the target vehicle before stepping it. Thus all these preprocessings are finished by calling `self.engine.before_step()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, through `self.engine.after_step()`, we can post-process, calculate, and collect some information after advancing the simulation. For example, we usually detect if the vehicle collides with buildings, humans, and other vehicles in the post-processing. In addition, the state update can be finished in the `after_step` stage as well if these properties are pre-calculated somewhere. For example, if we are replaying vehicle trajectories collected in the real world, we can set the velocity and positions of vehicles in this stage directly. **Note: the `decision_repeat` DOES NOT take effect in `engine.before_step` and `engine.after_step`**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we dive deeper to check the `engine.before_step()`, `engine.step()`, and `engine.after_step()`. We will find that all three functions share the same structure. Take the `before_step()` function as the example. It sequentially executes `mgr.before_step()` for each manager. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def before_step(self):\n",

    "What happens in `env.reset()` is similar to `env.step()`: sequentailly calling `before_reset()`, `reset()`, `after_reset()` for all managers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, the simulation and state transition are controlled and defined by chaining a set of managers. How to execute managers to do simulation is demonstrated in the following flow chart (supposing there are 2 managers in total and the repetition *N*=config[\"decision_repeat\"]).\n",

    "\n",
    "The transition function is implemented as a set of managers that concretely defines when to spawn or recycle objects and how to actuate existing objects. \n",
    "Thus different manager combinations result in different simulation results. \n",
    "MetaDrive composes different simulation environments by varying the managers, which are plugins essentially.\n",
    "To make a manager, we need to override the three step-related functions: `before_step()`, `step()`, and `after_step`, and two reset-related functions: `before_reset` and `reset`.\n",
    "After this, we need to register them in `env.setup_engine`. The registered manager can be accessed by `env.engine.managers[manager_id]` or `env.manager.manager_id`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Step\n",
    "Let's discuss the step-related ones. Most of the time, we don't need to override the `step()` function as advancing physics is executed by the physics engine already. Only override it when you have a different kinematic/dynamic model for a certain object. For example, if you want to use a customized bicycle model as the kinematics model of a vehicle, you need to put something into the `step()` function and calculate where the car is going to move given steering, throttle, position, heading, and velocity. Therefore, the key interface to developing a manager is `before_step()` and `after_step()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's create an example to illustrate what we can do with these two developer APIs. In the following example, a vehicle is generated at timestep 40, and recycled at timestep 100. In this period, the vehicle keeps turning left."

    "### Object APIs in Engine \n",
    "Actually, the three object APIs are wrappers for `engine.spawn_object`, `engine.get_objects()`, and `engine.clear_objects()`.\n",
    "The difference is the object APIs in the manager additionally modify the `manager.spawned_objects`.\n",
    "Therefore, developers can call the engine-based object APIs for managing objects as well.\n",
    "However, keep in mind that cross-manipulation is prohibited. \n",
    "Objects created by manager-based object API should be recycled by `manager.clear_objects()`, while those created by `engine.spawn_object` must be recycled by `engine.clear_objects()`. Similarly, objects created by manager 1 can not be recycled by manager 2.\n",
    "These behaviors will induce bugs. \n",
    "\n",
    "All generated objects no matter by which manager it is created are recorded in `engine._spawned_objects`. Thus the engine-based object API will traverse all objects instead of a specific manager-created ones when getting and clearing objects. The engine also has underlying mechanisms to detect and avoid memory leaks like checking if all objects are cleared when creating a new scenario. Despite this, we still recommend using managers to manage your scene, which can be viewed as a \"sub-engine\" with complex optimization in hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Policy\n",
    "The policy is usually associated with objects, especially those whose properties need to be changed.\n",
    "For example, the throttle and steering of a vehicle have to be changed to move toward the destination.\n",
    "How to change these properties can be determined by policies inherited from `BasePolicy` with the `policy.act()` overridden.\n",
    "Thus calling `policy.act()` is to make one decision according to the policy. \n",
    "This function is supposed to return some decisions for an object such as control signals for a vehicle.\n",
    "Here, we discuss APIs for creating and accessing policies.\n",
    "For customizing a policy, please refer to <a href=\"action.html#customization\">Policy Customization</a>. \n",
    "\n",
    "### APIs\n",
    "A policy can be added for an object through `manager.add_policy`.\n",
    "Similar to `spawn_object()`, typical usage of this API is as follows.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "policy = add_policy(object_id,  PolicyClass, policy_argument_1, policy_argument_2) \n",
    "```\n",
    "It is the same as\n",
    "```python\n",
    "policy = PolicyClass(policy_argument_1, policy_argument_2)\n",
    "```\n",
    "By having the `object_id` recorded by the engine, we can access the policy of an object everywhere.\n",
    "A policy for the corresponding object can be accessed by `engine.get_policy(object_id)` or `manager.get_policy(object_id)`. The latter one is implemented by calling the former one, so these two methods have no difference. Whenever an object is cleared through `engine.clear_objects` or `manager.clear_objects`, the policy associated with it will be cleared and destroyed as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "This example demonstrates how to add a policy for an object generated and managed by a manager.\n",
    "We added an IDMPolicy for the generated object, so it can drive toward the destination."
