To receive debug messages, set `debug=True` in the config when creating the environment. In debug mode, the `log_level` will be changed to `logging.DEBUG`, so you will get more information from MetaDrive, Panda3D, and RenderPipeline in the console."

Specifying `debug=True` in environment config can turn on the debug mode. In this mode, you can visualize the physics world by pressing `1` (the one near `~`) on your keyboard. In the following example, we have automatically turned on the physics world visualizer for you by `env.engine.toggleDebug()`. Pressing `1` can turn if off."

    "The default debug mode only visualizes the object in the world called **\"dynamics physics world\"**. In this world, objects can have interactions following the physics law like collision, friction, and gravity. At the same time, there exists another physics world called **\"static physics world\"**, where objects won't participate in collision and enjoy zero gravity. However, one can still query this world to know if an object in dynamics physics world has contact with objects in the static physics world. Therefore, we usually put objects that are still like crosswalks, lane lines and lanes in this world. As a result, we can know which lane the car is on or if it is on a lane line or sidewalk, while keep the simulation at a high FPS as we only *step* the dynamics physics world.\n",

You will also experience a FPS drop, which explains why we separate the physics world into two."
